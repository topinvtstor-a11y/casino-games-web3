## Project Structure

### Frontend (Port: 8800)

The frontend is a React-based single-page application that provides:

* Interactive game UI with real-time updates
* Web3 wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)
* User authentication (Email, Google OAuth, Web3 wallet)
* Real-time Socket.IO connections for live game updates
* User account dashboard with balance, history, and settings
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
* Multi-language support (if configured)

**Key Technologies:**
* React 18.2.0
* Redux for state management
* Material-UI for components
* Web3.js and Ethers.js for blockchain interactions
* Socket.IO client for real-time communication
* Axios for API requests

### Admin Panel (Port: 9000)

Comprehensive admin dashboard for platform management:

* User management and moderation
* Game configuration and settings
* Live transaction monitoring
* Platform analytics and statistics
* Revenue tracking and reporting
* Campaign and promotion management
* System health monitoring

### Backend (Microservices Architecture)

The backend is built using a microservices architecture with separate services for each game and functionality:

| Service | Port | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Main Server | 5000 | Core API server handling authentication, payments, and user management |
| Admin Service | 6100 | Admin panel backend service |
| Management Service | 4000 | Platform management and analytics service |
| Chatroom Service | 4900 | Real-time chat system for user communication |
| Scissors Game | 5200 | Scissors game service with Socket.IO |
| Mines Game | 5300 | Mines game service with Socket.IO |
| Dice Game | 5400 | Dice game service with Socket.IO |
| Slot Game | 5500 | Slot game service with Socket.IO |
| Plinko Game | 5600 | Plinko game service with Socket.IO |
| Crash Game | 5700 | Crash game service with Socket.IO |
| Turtle Race | 5100 | Turtle race game service with Socket.IO |

Each game service operates independently with its own Socket.IO server for real-time gameplay, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js v16 or higher (for Backend services)
* Node.js v14 or higher (for Frontend and Admin panel)
* MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
* npm or yarn package manager
* Git for version control
* Web crypto wallet extension (MetaMask, TrustWallet, etc.) for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Web3-Casino-Crash-Game-Gamefi
```

2. Install dependencies for each component:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Admin Panel
cd ../admin
npm install
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory (see Configuration section)

4. Start the main server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Start additional game services (in separate terminals or as background processes):
```bash
npm run admin          # Admin service (port 6100)
npm run manage         # Management service (port 4000)
npm run chatroom       # Chat service (port 4900)
npm run crash          # Crash game (port 5700)
npm run dice           # Dice game (port 5400)
npm run mines          # Mines game (port 5300)
npm run scissors       # Scissors game (port 5200)
npm run slot           # Slot game (port 5500)
npm run plinko         # Plinko game (port 5600)
npm run turtle         # Turtle race (port 5100)
```

**Note:** All services use `npx nodemon` for automatic restart on code changes during development.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Create a `.env` file (optional, for Google OAuth):
```env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8800`

### Admin Panel Setup

1. Navigate to the admin directory:
```bash
cd admin
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the admin panel:
```bash
npm start
```

The admin panel will be available at `http://localhost:9000` (or the configured port)

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
SERVER_PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/PlayZelo?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_random_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRE=1h

# Tatum API (for crypto payments)
TATUM_API_KEY_TESTNET=your_testnet_api_key
TATUM_API_KEY_MAINNET=your_mainnet_api_key

# Infura (Ethereum provider)
INFURA_URL_TESTNET=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_infura_key
INFURA_URL_MAINNET=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_infura_key

# Network Configuration
NETWORK=mainnet
DEV_MODE=false

# Email Service (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend configuration is located in `frontend/src/config/baseConfig.js`. 

To switch between local and production environments, modify the `isLocal` variable:

```javascript
const isLocal = true;  // Set to false for production
```

For local development, the frontend will connect to:
* API: `http://localhost:5000/api`
* Socket Server: `http://localhost:4000`
* Chat Socket: `http://localhost:4900`

### Admin Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `admin` directory:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_this_password
ADMIN_AUTH_KEY=your_auth_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

---

## Security Features

The platform implements multiple security measures:

* **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for all API requests
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional 2FA using TOTP for enhanced account security
* **Secure Wallet Integration**: Web3 wallet connections with signature verification
* **CORS Protection**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
* **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
* **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
* **Secure Password Hashing**: Bcrypt for password storage
* **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables, not in code

**Important Security Note:** Never commit `.env` files to version control. Always use `.env.example` files as templates.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use:**
If a port is already in use, either stop the conflicting service or change the port in the configuration file.

**MongoDB Connection Error:**
Ensure MongoDB is running and the connection string in `.env` is correct. Check network connectivity for cloud MongoDB instances.

**Module Not Found:**
Run `npm install` again in the affected directory. Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag if you encounter peer dependency conflicts.

**Socket.IO Connection Issues:**
Verify that the Socket.IO server is running and the client is configured with the correct URL in `baseConfig.js`.

**Web3 Wallet Connection:**
Ensure you have a Web3 wallet extension installed (MetaMask, etc.) and are on a supported network.
